### Rating

I rate this game from 1 to 5 stars as a 4.5 star.

## Summary

'Evil Hunter Tycoon' is a simulation game and RPG about creating hunters that are strong enough to defeat the Darlk Lord. The game is an isometric, pixel game that also comes with a variety of different types of hunters. To create strong hunters you are tasked with rebuilding the town, and helping upgrade the hunters that wonder into your town.

There are a variety of ways to upgrade your hunters, and you can unlock more ways to strengthen them by upgrading your facilities in town or by building new ones. You can help evolve a hunters class or change their class if you have the right facilities and materials. Meanwhile, the Academy teaches hunters skills and secret techiniques! When a hunter dies from a monster they can be revived at the Sanctuary.

To gather materials to upgrade your buildings, create equipment, or upgrade your hunters; you can send you hunters out on expeditions oustide the town. If you're up for a challenge or want to get unique items or materials, once you hunters have become fairly strong you can send them off to explore the dungeons and fight boss monsters! Once you have defeated the Dark Lord you can restart your town at a higher difficulty! 'Evil Hunter Tycoon' has multiple difficulties that you can challenege once you complete the previous difficulty, which tests the players management skills.

## Final Thoughts

'Evil Hunter Tycoon' is a fun game to play and I quite enjoy upgrading the hunters and making them stronger. Seeing their costumes change too is also satisfying to see when you updrade their classes. I also enjoyed being able build facilities anywhere you want within the building area, and you can even decorate your town with paths and nature items. However, when it comes to management I do beleive there is quite a bit of micro management. The amount of micro management is a bit stressful at times, especially when you are playing at a higher difficulty. It's also a bit annoying that boss/dungeon timers do not continue counting down if you close the game. Othererwise, this game would be a 5 star to me if these were changed.
