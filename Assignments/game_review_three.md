## Summary

Dragon Raja is a chinese MMORPG, where you take on the role as a orphan with special dragon genes that have been imbued into you. Due to an 'accident,' you wake up 20 years later and end up embarking on a quest to stop an evil organization from unleashing the Dragon Lord; who wishes to achieve world domination in Dragon Raja. Until aroudn level 120, your character is not the main character of the story. Instead, yor character helps the non-player characters achieve this quest of stopping the Dragon Lord. 

In Dragon Raja, there are multiple classes that you can play as, and you can switch tp any class with one character buy using gold coins. Gold coins are basically the basic currency in the game. There are multiple physical attacking classes and magic attacking class. Physical classes are: Blademaster, gunslinger, and fighter. Magic attack classes are: Souldancers, phantom sounds, assassins, reaper, and puppeteers. Souldancers and Puppeteers are good for support and healing. Blademaster and figher are good for defense. Assassins are good at doding skills and attacking. Reapers are good at stealing other players health points and range attacks. Gunslingers are good at using stuns and attack from a range while moving. Meanwhile, phantom sounds is the most recent class that has a high range dps, and is basically a broken class that has been nerfed once, but could use another nerf. However, it is mostly likely not going to get fixed. 

When it comes to gaining better gear and other items to help you increase your characters stats; there are mutliple activites/features you can do to get stronger. One of the main ways to get better gear is to do your weekly dungeons. For more exp, it is recommended to keep up with the main/story quest. Then there are your dailies, which are small, easy dungeons that get reset every day. You dailies are: two rounds of Devilawake, one pumpkin time dungeon, and three dragon hunting quests. You also have the limited time, daily dungeons that appear at two different times in the game called, Undersea. Then there are the clubs, which have their own events that occur at certain times of the week/days. There are multiple other events that you can do in the game, especially pvp events such as normal pvp, teams pvp, and then there are events like chess. Overall, this game has multiple features that you can do in the game.

If you need help or want to talk to other people there are your usual chats such as; club chat, world chat, team chat, and etc... Not to mention the emojis are really fun to use and there are a lot of them. Then you have a friend list where you can also privatelty talk to your friends and even make group chats with them. Lastly there is an area called moments, where you can post images or updates for others to see. You can like or comment on another persons post too. 

## Final Thoughts

I personally emjoy this game for it's asethetics and character customization. The game has numerous outfits and hairtsyles that you can wear, and even dye them different colors. The story and nvoice acting is pretty good in the beginning, but in the more recent chapters it's gotten a bit confusing and it seems that the voice actors were changed. This is mostly likely due to the panademic that is going on right now though. Another thing that may be a major turn off to others is that the game has quite the amount of pay to win people, so if your fine with not being at the top of the leaderboards this game should be fun for you. If your competitive, the only way to be the best player is to spend lots of money. However, this game has multiple features that you can do in the game to keep you from getting bored.
