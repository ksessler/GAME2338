## Summary

This game is about a boy named Evan, who is blessed by the Goddess Elena. She gives her power to Evan so that he can hopefully, put an end to the war in Asgard among the seven knights. These seven knights each hold the power of the God of Destruction. At first you start off with Evan as your only team member, but eventually you run into a girl named Karin. Karin is then added to your team as a healer once you rescue her from the goblins. 

Seven Knights is a turn-based rpg. You can have up to seven charaters in your team, and there is a slot for a pet that will give a certain buff to your team. Your characters speed and your enemies speed will be the deciding factor on who attacks first. It's also not a wise idea to use the same team all the time because certain quests will require you to use characters that have a certain skill. You can easily get every character through the gacha-pull syatem, but the developers also give many free rewards so you will most likely end up with at least one special character within a week. 

To be able to clear special event quests or raids you will usually need to use the recomended characters to be able to beat them. There are also club events where you fight against other clubs, and usually every week there is one special charater that you are not allowed to use; so you are encouraged to upgrade multiple different characters. When it comes to normal quests you can usually stick with a regular team, until you get to around world 9. That's when you want to make sure you have a team that is mostly made of special characters, that are fairly powered-up.

One of the newwer features of the game is called awakening, which is basically a third evoltution for some characters. Only special characters can be awakened, and not allof them have been given one. However, this feature was added to help players progress through more of the main quests, and raids. 

You can also strengthen your characters by upgrading their skills, giving them better gear and accessories that can also be upgraded and awakend. You can get gear and accessories from the main quests, gacha-pulls, club events, and special quests. 

When it comes to PvP, I'd say the game is fairly balanced between free to play players and pay to win players. After playing for a few months it is possible to get at least one fully upgraded team. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I quite enjoy the game and it's a fun game that you can play casually. I also like that there is no paywall to get specical custumes for you characters, which are quite fun to collect. My only complaint would be that the main quests can be difficult to get through once you've reached a certain point, so you are kind of forced to upgrade a specific character to get through a quest.
