### 1. Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo Entertainment System contains multiple perspectives of quality. 
Transcedent: When you play the game everything looks correct. There are no random pixels sticking out, and the characters/world are properly colored and shaded. Product-based: The users expect the game to allow you jump and run with your character. You play as Mario or Luigi depending on if you're the first or second player during co-op. User-based: The game is meant for all ages, and is easy to understand for new players. Development and manufacturing based: The game runs smoothly and without game breaking bugs appearing while playing. 

### 2. Minecraft

Minecraft is a quality game that is known for it's flexibilty with routinely getting updates every three months or so, to add new features or fix old ones. Maintainability can also be seen with this game because the programmers/developers are also quick and precise most of the time when it comes to fixing issues inside the game. Another quality factor that the game has is portability. You can play Minecraft on multiple devices and systems. You can run it on pc using Java, on mobile, or on a console such as Playstation or Xbox. Minecraft is also known for it's usability, with others being able to understand it's software (Java) so that they can create mods for the game. 

### 3. Angry Birds

Even though the original Angry Birds game no longer exists on mobile, during it's time it was one of the most popular games in 2009-2012. It reusability can be seen with the more recent games, that still uses some of the same or similar code as the orginal. Specifically Angry Birds 2 and Angry Birds Friends. It was also one of those user friendly games that nearly anyone of all ages could enjoy. Everytime you came across a new bird, the game would teach you how to use them. So, you could say they game was heavely user-based in quality since it was a game that even those that had the busiest of schedules could play. Maintainability and flexibility can also be seen with the new games getting updated every one and a half weeks or so. These updates either come with new features or bug fixes.
